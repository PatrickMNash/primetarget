      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        Prime Target is a math game. It is a relatively simple concept that proves more challenging than it might appear
        at first.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Play</h2>

      <p>
        The concept is fairly simple, subtract values from a starting value until a target value is reached, undershot,
        or until moves have been exhausted.
      </p>

      <h2>The Game Interface</h2>
      <p>
        The game interface is a simple 3x3 grid of colored squares.
      </p>

      <div class="parent">
        <div id="shots" class="pad blue">1</div>
        <div id="current-value" class="pad red">2</div>
        <div id="score" class="pad blue">3</div>
        <div id="choice-one" class="pad red">4</div>
        <div id="choice-two" class="pad yellow">5</div>
        <div id="choice-three" class="pad red">6</div>
        <div id="current-level" class="pad blue">7</div>
        <div id="target" class="pad red">8</div>
        <div id="continue" class="pad blue">9</div>
      </div>

      <h3>The Meaning Of Each Square In The Grid</h3>

      <h4>Square 1</h4>
      <p>
        Square 1 is the number of moves you have left in the current round. As you select values to subtract this
        number will decrease by 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the level of the game increases the number of moves decreases until you reach level 7 and 3 moves.
        This is the minimal number of moves.
      </p>

      <h4>Square 2</h4>
      <p>
        Square 2 is the starting value and current value after performing a subtraction.
      </p>

      <h4>Square 3</h4>
      <p>
        Square 3 is your current score.
      </p>

      <h4>Squares 4-6</h4>
      <p>
        Squares 4, 5, and 6 are the available values you can subtract from Square 2.
      </p>

      <h4>Square 7</h4>
      <p>
        Square 7 is the current level. Every time the target value is reached the level increases by 1.
      </p>

      <h4>Square 8</h4>
      <p>
        Square 8 is the target value that must be reached in order to succesfullly complete a level.
      </p>

      <h4>Square 9</h4>
      <p>
        Square 9 is "hearts". Pressing Square 9 allows you to subtract 1 from Square 2. This does not count
        against Square 1 (moves remaining). Performing multiple decrements is allowed.
      </p>

      <h2>Losing Hearts</h2>
      <p>
        If a round ends without reaching the target (Square 8) then hearts are subtracted from the total in Square 9.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until level 7 is reached 1 heart is subtracted per round if the target (Square 8) is missed. At level
        7 the penalty increases to 2. Going forward when a level is reached which is a multiple of 7 the
        penalty increases by 1. Example: The penalty at level 49 would be: 49 / 7 = 7, 7 + 1 = 8 hearts
        deducted if the target is missed.
      </p>

      <h2>Gaining Hearts</h2>
      <p>
        When the target is reached and the level is advanced, 1 heart is added to the total in Square 9.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Over</h2>
      <p>
        The game is over when there are 0 hearts left in Square 9 and the round ends with the target (Square
        8) being missed.
      </p>
